      <a name="dlg_registercompilers"></a>Unregistered Delphi Installation(s)
      Detected Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed at program start-up if <em>CodeSnip</em>
      detects that Delphi compilers are installed on the user's system that have
      not yet been registered for use by <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The available compilers are listed at the top of the dialogue box. Each
      compiler has a check box to its left. You should tick this check box to
      permit <em>CodeSnip</em> to register the compiler or leave it clear if you
      don't want to register the compiler with <em>CodeSnip</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath the list of compilers are some instructions about how to
      disable auto-registration of some or all compilers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have made your selection click the <em>OK</em> button to register
      the selected compilers with <em>CodeSnip</em>. A message box will pop up
      to confirm that the compilers have been registered.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Preventing automatic detection
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can prevent <em>CodeSnip</em> from checking for <strong>any</strong>
      new compilers on startup in future by ticking the <em>Don't show this
      again</em> check box before clicking <em>OK</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you change your mind startup checks can be re-enabled. Alternatively
      you can exclude individual Delphi compilers from automatic detection.
      For information about how to do this see <a
